    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a graduate of the School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science at University College Dublin with a bachelor's degree in microbiology. My academic background has equipped me with a strong foundation in microbiological techniques and laboratory practices. Currently, I am contributing to the healthcare sector through my role at ICON plc.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p><strong>Bachelor of Science in Microbiology</strong><br />
    University College Dublin<br />
    Graduated: 2022</p>
    <p>I started with a general biology degree in my first year, mainly studying basic chemistry, ecology and zoology. I further specialized in environmental biology, zoology and microbiology in my second year. In the third and fourth years of my degree, I specialised solely in microbiology. As with any science degree, my workload comprised a huge amount of independent research and study. However, as a microbiologist, I could participate in a lot of practical lab work and team projects. Within microbiology, I was able to study a wide variety of topics; from the more industrial side of microbiology like bioprocesses; to a more environmental side in microbial ecology. For my final year, I had to complete a thesis project titled "The Effect of Bile on Gene Expression in Staphylococcus epidermidis". As part of this project, I had to carry out independent research in the lab and present my results to my classmates.</p>
